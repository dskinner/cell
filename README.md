# Cell

Explores cellular automata. Current rules available for Conway's Game of Life and rules taken from Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.

## Installation

Requires various C development headers that I've long since forgotten about to install `gogl`. Use the following and inspect errors to determine the appropriate headers needed.

```
go get dasa.cc/cell
```

## Run

```
cell -h
```
